## Go baby steps

Some examples of the Go language that I compile while learning it. 

The project structure is based on https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout and therefore might
contain empty example files or directories.

## Structure

### cmd

Under [cmd](cmd), you can find the relevant example projects containing main.go files for different go feature demos.

### pkg

Under [pkg](pkg), you can find open packages that can be used elsewhere.
